How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Ripple's main process is a payment settlement asset exchange and remittance system, similar to the SWIFT system for international money and security transfers, which is used by banks and financial middlemen dealing across currencies. Ripple operates on an open-source and peer-to-peer decentralized platform that allows for a seamless transfer of money in any form, whether it's dollars, yen, euros, or cryptocurrencies, like litecoin or bitcoin. Ripple is a global payments network and counts major banks and financial services amongst its customers. XRP is used in its products to facilitate quick conversion between different currencies
How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

The primary source of funding Ripple has been sales of the XRP cryptocurrency. According to its own records it sold $1,254.54 million worth of XRP between Q4 2016 and Q2 2020, to a mix of institutional investors and retail investors via sales on cryptoccurrency exchanges. Ripple is a privately funded company. It has closed five rounds of funding, which included two rounds of angel funding, one round of seed funding, one Series A round, one Series B round and one Series C round.
Business Activities:
What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Ripple aims to provide an efficient system for the direct transfer of money that settles in real-time, while being cheaper, more secure and more transparent than other transfer systems employed by traditional financial institutions.
Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Financial Institutions
Ripple is attempting to change the way of conducting cross-border payments, using blockchain and cryptocurrency technology to bridge between fiat currencies.
Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Ripple is a blockchain-based digital payment network and protocol with its own cryptocurrency, XRP.
Landscape:
What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Blockchain / Computer Technology
What has been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Eco-friendly Blockchain - blockchain technology brings the pitfalls of continuously increasing levels of carbon emissions Many new innovative approaches such as carbon offsetting are evolving as answers to such problems. However, carbon offsetting is more of a remedial measure for an incident that should not have happened in the first place.
Central Banks Digital Currencies - developing national currencies generally focus on digital currencies, which can work alongside the existing traditional currencies. Therefore, the trends in blockchain could enable users to carry out financial transactions and manage the custody of their assets. Interestingly, users don’t have to rely on third-party providers, and central banks could also exercise control over the circulating supply.
Manufacturing and Tracking Vaccines with Blockchain - blockchain could serve as an ideal instrument for verifying the authenticity of vaccine shipments. Could also help in tracing the distribution of vaccines to ensure that the vaccines reach the desired locations. Could strengthen the verification of vaccine integrity at different points in the supply chain. For example, blockchain technology can help in ensuring the consistent storage of vaccine batches at the right temperature.
Tokenization, Non-fungible tokens or NFTs - the potential of NFTs, exceeds far beyond their initial use cases
The Rise of the Metaverse- The metaverse is basically a shared, virtual world that offers immersive experiences. Participants can interact with the metaverse by using their digital avatars. The avatars could help in interacting with each other, creating in-world experiences, objects, and landscapes.
Transformation in financial services - decentralized ledgers for payments could mean faster payments and lower fees, and that distributed ledger technology has the potential to reduce costs and make real-time transactions between financial institutions a reality. Could help to re-imagine global trade finance by driving efficiencies, lowering costs and opening up new revenue opportunities.

Results
What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Has partnerships with banks - accepted by hundred significant banks and other big fishes like MUFG, BBVA, SEB, Axis Bank, and many more.
Transaction Protocol - The transaction protocol of Ripple is utilized for an assortment of purposes, including moving/getting cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, and information. This protocol can manage large transactions around the globe, and it relatively comes with lower fees.
Rate of Interest - As it is being adopted worldwide, there has been a stable increment in Ripple’s price.
Accessibility - Global crypto exchanges such as Gemini, Coinbase and Binance allow you to trade Ripple (XRP)
Scalability - Ripple will grow higher in the future. Generally has no connection with the external market shocks and price volatilities. What makes Ripple an exception from other cryptocurrencies is, it has a huge market cap, and it utilizes consensus ledgers when it comes to transactions.
Public Relations - enhances brand awareness by building up their culture and image in front of the eyes of commercial enthusiasts and ordinary people as well.
Low Fees - Ripple has a speedy transaction time and comparably low transaction fees.
What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Active Nodes (Active Addresses) - Measured by collecting and recording how many unique nodes are active during a predetermined time span, such as per day, per week or per month. In permissionless blockchains, the greater the number, the greater the indication that more nodes are using and trusting the blockchain application. The active nodes value is generally made available to all participating nodes.
Blocks Per Hour, Blocks Per Day - Measure the speed at which records are submitted and stored on the blockchain network and how fast the network can carry out its consensus algorithm. Because the capacity of a block is fixed, the quantity of blocks processed can be calculated accordingly. Every block that is created has a timestamp (as per the timestamp header covered earlier in the Understanding Blocks and Chains section). Via the use of timestamps, the blockchain system can measure how many blocks are created and added during specified time periods, such as per hour or per day. The results of these measurements help assess the performance and scalability of the blockchain system.
Transactions Per Second - Measures the quantity of records or transaction records submitted and stored per second. It is used to assess the volume of processing a blockchain network is undergoing and to judge its scalability requirements. The quantity of records submitted to the network and the quantity of records stored to the ledger are generally measured separately.
Transaction Latency - Measures the time from which a transaction is submitted to the network until the time that the transaction has been written to the ledger (or rejected). This metric is measured by checking the timestamp of transactions and comparing the time they were submitted to the time they were validated and stored. This metric can also provide insight as to how fast consensus algorithms are being carried out.
Transaction Throughput - This metric is used to measure the time it takes for valid records to be appended to blocks. The total number of committed and validated records is divided by the total amount of time (in seconds) it takes to commit (validate and store) those records. Any invalid records or transaction records are deducted from the total number because invalid records are not committed.
Full Node/Partial Node Ratio - Measures the quantity of active full nodes and partial nodes on a blockchain network and provides a value representing the ratio of full to partial nodes. This measurement is important because if a blockchain network ends up having no active full nodes, it can lose the historical data in the full copy of the distributed ledger. Because of the critical importance of maintaining sufficient redundant copies of the distributed ledger, this measurement is closely tracked.
Ripple settlement speed is exponentially faster than competitors. Ripple settles in approximately 4 seconds while ETH is 4+ minutes and bitcoin is 1+ hours. Traditional Systems settle between 3-5 days.
How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Banks, financial institution, government agencies and corporates are all looking for a blockchain solution that is fast enough to process transactions on an immutable, decentralized ledger in a way that supports near-instant responsiveness for Internet-and-mobile based software. Ripple provides and has the ability to transform the globe’s cross-border value transfer into an instant communication system where transitioning from one currency to another takes only a few seconds instead of days.
Recommendations
If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Decentralized finance. (DeFi) crypto staking and investment services. Decentralized finance eliminates intermediaries by allowing people, merchants, and businesses to conduct financial transactions through emerging technology. This is accomplished through peer-to-peer financial networks that use security protocols, connectivity, software, and hardware advancements. Gives users more control over their money through personal wallets and trading services that cater to individuals.
Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Since all the XRP coins are pre-mined and already in circulation, a limited supply could push up demand in the future, leading to big price increases and bigger profits for early investors. Staking is a way of supporting the blockchain of a cryptocurrency you're invested in. Cryptocurrencies rely on holders staking to verify transactions and keep everything running smoothly. It's an easy way to earn interest on your cryptocurrency holdings. Helps to maintain the security and efficiency of the blockchain.
What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

- Will entice long term holders to stay invested as they will be aquiring additional interest.
